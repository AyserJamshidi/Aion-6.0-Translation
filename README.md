# Warning
Using this translation breaks a lot of the quest locating features.  Normal /where works fine but using the locate button on the quest dialogs will usually return "Hard to find".  Use Korean dialog in the mean time if you are questing.  
I am actively working on this amongst other translations.

Step 3: Delete the **ui** and **Strings** folder only if they exist.  
Step 4: Open the downloaded Aion-6.0-Translation.zip file.
