# Note
Every Wednesday Aion Korea pushes out maintenance.  Please keep an eye out for 6.0 translation updates here every week (few days is preferred) so you don't have missing text or malfunctioning UI.  Every week since 6.0 so far they have added content that I add after translation.

# Warning
Using this translation breaks a lot of the quest locating features.  Normal /where works fine but using the locate button on the quest dialogs will usually return "Hard to find".  Use Korean dialog in the mean time if you are questing.  
I am actively working on this amongst other translations.

# Instructions/Updating
Step 1: Click "Clone or download"

Step 2: Open your **AION_KR/l10n/kor/data/** folder.  
Step 3: Delete the **ui** and **Strings** folder only if they exist.  
Step 4: Open the downloaded Aion-6.0-Translation.zip file.  
Step 5: Open the main folder until you see multiple folders (ui/strings).  Drag and drop that into the folder you just opened.  
Step 6: Reopen Aion if you haven't already.  

# Help!  I Updated But Nothing Happened!
Aion keeps a cache of all language localization files.  This file is located inside the **Aion_KR/data** folder.  Once you've accessed the data folder look for a folder called **dump**.  Delete it and you will now have your game recreate its localization cache once you've opened your game again.

# Status 
Folder Name | Status
-------------------------- | --------------------------  
Strings Folder | Actively being worked on  
UI Folder | 100%
